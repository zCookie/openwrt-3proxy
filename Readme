3proxy    	Combined proxy server may be used as
		Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista
		executable or service (supports installation and removal).
		It uses config file to read it's configuration (see
		3proxy.cfg.sample for details).
		--install installs and starts proxy as NT/2000/XP service
		(config file should be located in the same directory)
		--remove removes the service (should be stopped before via
		net stop 3proxy).
		3proxy.exe is all-in-one, it doesn't require all others .exe
		to work.
		See 3proxy.cfg.sample for examples, see man 3proxy.cfg
